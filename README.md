# EdgeDetection
Experimenting with Roberts and Sobel edge detection algorithms

In this code I experiment with the Robert and Sobel edge detection
algorithms. The motivation is a PluralSight course by Janani Ravi.

Remember that one of the best ways to learn is to read, experiment,
and repeat.

If interested in additional comments regarding this code I invite 
yout to read the follwoing post:
